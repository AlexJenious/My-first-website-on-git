                <h4>FC Hogwarts Gryffindor: The story of the team that played magical football</h4>

                <h4>Foundation and early years:</h4>
                <p>
                    It all started not at the Quidditch World Cup, but in the backyard of Little Whinging School in 2005. Harry Potter, already famous throughout the magical world, was visiting his relatives, the Dursleys (as required by the terms of his guardianship). To keep himself from going stir-crazy, he played ball with Dudley, who unexpectedly enjoyed his cousin's company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neighboring children joined them. Harry, who had never played soccer (it wasn't popular in the wizarding world), looked awkward at first. But his magical agility, honed on broomsticks, quickly made itself felt. He couldn't use magic, but his reaction, vision, and ability to predict the ball's trajectory were phenomenal. He became a self-taught goalkeeper who saved impossible shots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They named the team the Garry Potter Football Team — with two “r”s in Garry's name to avoid confusion with the famous wizard. It was their little secret.
                </p>

                <h4>Forming a style:</h4>
                <p>Returning to Hogwarts for his final year, Harry, remembering the fun he had in the courtyard, suggested organizing a football team. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger enthusiastically embraced the idea.</p>
                <p>The team was formed from Gryffindors, but was open to everyone. Their style of play was as unique as their captain:</p>

                <p><a href="../players/harry-potter.html" class="nickname">Harry Potter</a> (Goalkeeper/Captain): He was nicknamed <strong>“The Seer Goalkeeper.”</strong> He almost never moved from his spot for regular shots, but made incredible saves, as if he could see the ball's trajectory a second before it was hit. His cry of “I see it!” struck fear into his opponents.</p>
                <p><a href="../players/ron-weasley.html" class="nickname">Ron Weasley</a> (Center Back): A psychologically weak player, prone to mistakes under pressure. But when Harry or Hermione shouted words of encouragement (or teased him), he turned into the <strong>“Weasley Wall”</strong> — an impenetrable defender who blocked shots with his whole body.</p>
                <p><a href="../players/hermione-granger.html" class="nickname">Hermione Granger</a> (Center Midfielder / Team Brain): She learned all the rules, tactics, and history of soccer in a week. Hermione was never the fastest runner, but her passes were mathematically precise. She was the <strong>“Dispatcher”</strong> who saw the field as if she had a chessboard in front of her eyes.</p>
                <p><a href="../players/neville-longbottom.html" class="nickname">Neville Longbottom</a> (Defensive Midfielder): Clumsy, but incredibly dedicated to the team. After each of his mistakes, the team united even more strongly. But once, when an opponent deliberately knocked Hermione down, the quiet Neville made a tough tackle, after which the opponent remembered the name <strong>“Longbottom-Wall”</strong> for a long time.</p>

                <h4>Tactics:</h4>
                <p>Harry Potter played on the counterattack. Strong defense led by Ron and Neville, accurate first passes from Hermione to the speedy Ginny and other attackers. And if an opponent got through, Harry stood in their way. Their motto: “<em>Gryffindor's Heart, Football's Art</em>.”</p>

                <h4>Legendary match:</h4>
                <p>
                    In 2008, the team participated in an amateur tournament in Godric's Hollow. In the final, they faced the favorite team, the Slytherin Broomsticks — a rough, technical team made up of former Slytherin students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Broomsticks led 2-0, gradually breaking through the Gryffindors' defensive lines. Ron was on the verge of breaking down after his own mistake. But after the break, Hermione changed tactics. She moved deeper, and Ginny stretched the opponent's defense. Neville, inspired by Harry's words, made a key tackle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The score was tied at 2-2. In the last minute of the match, the opponent was awarded a penalty. Everyone thought the game was over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Harry Potter looked at the ball. Captain. Goalkeeper. Hero. He took a few steps forward from the goal line, as if challenging the striker to a duel. The shot was powerful and aimed at the top corner. Harry made a jump that was impossible to explain by physics. He saved it. His trident, visible under his shirt, glinted in the sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whistle blew. Regular time was over. In the penalty shootout, Harry Potter was unbeatable, because their goalkeeper could see the future.
                </p>

                <h4>Legacy:</h4>
                <p>
                    The Garry Potter Football Team still exists today. It never turned professional, but it remains a local football legend. Former players bring their children, and Harry Potter sometimes comes to important matches, sitting modestly in the stands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They didn't win millions, but they found another way to be together after all the battles. They proved that real magic is not just spells, but also belief in the team, friendship that lifts you up after you fall, and the incredible power of a seemingly ordinary game that unites people regardless of whether they can fly on broomsticks.
