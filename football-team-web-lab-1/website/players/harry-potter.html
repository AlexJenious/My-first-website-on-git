            <h4>What does he mean to the team?</h4>
            <p>
                Harry is the undisputed leader and symbol of the team. His incredible ability to predict the movement of the ball a second ahead makes him the most reliable last bastion. For the team, he is the eyes and voice of hope; his cry of "I see it!" instills confidence in the defenders and fear in the opponents' attackers. He is not just a player, he is the vision and heart of Garry Potter FC.
            </p>

            <h4>His contribution and key moments:</h4>
            <p>
                His legendary penalty save from Draco Malfoy in the final against Slytherin brought the team the Cup. But most importantly, he was the initiator of the team's creation, turning an ordinary game in the backyard of Little Whinging into a true legend. His ability to see the game as a whole and motivate the team in the most difficult moments has saved the day more than once.
            </p>
