            <h4>What does he mean to the team?</h4>
            <p>
                Ron is the embodiment of the team's belief that "strength lies in unity." When his psychological defense falters, it is the team's support that transforms him into an impenetrable wall. He lives and breathes the game, and his emotional nature, which sometimes brings him down, has never once stopped him from making the most crucial save when it was needed the most.
            </p>

            <h4>His contribution and key moments:</h4>
            <p>
                His key saves in the playoff matches, especially in the game against the "Hufflepuff Badgers" on a wet and slippery pitch, were a turning point in the tournament. He proved that the most important magic is the belief of your comrades in you.
