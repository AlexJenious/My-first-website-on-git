        <h2 class="event-title">Tournament for the Cup of the Fire Wizard</h2>
        <p>The tournament was held in Hogsmeade, and its symbol was the Goblet of Fire, reminiscent of the Triwizard Tournament. The team faced an unexpected obstacleâ€”heavy rain and mud, which leveled the playing field between the technical and physical teams. But Harry Potter's team was ready. They played simple but effective football, using long passes to the speedy Ginny. The key to victory came when Ron Weasley, covered in mud, threw himself at the opponent's striker's feet and deflected the ball on the fly, making a saving tackle. After that, Harry organized a quick attack, finding Hermione with a pass, who delivered a perfect cross to Ginny for the winning goal. They won not because of clean play, but because of the struggle and dedication of each player.</p>
