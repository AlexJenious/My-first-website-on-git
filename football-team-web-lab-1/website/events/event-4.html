        <p>It wasn't an official match, but it was this event that made the team a real family. Ron suggested holding a night training session at the edge of the Forbidden Forest to practice playing in poor visibility conditions. Things didn't go according to plan when a flock of playful creatures swooped down on the flying ball version of the Quaffle and carried it deep into the forest. Without hesitation, the team rushed to search for it. They fought through cobweb traps, navigated by the moon, and even used Hermione's advanced spellcasting skills to restore the trail. This adventure, where everyone relied on each other, turned out to be the best training for teamwork. Not only did they find the ball, but they also found a new level of trust in each other, which helped them on the field more than once.</p>
