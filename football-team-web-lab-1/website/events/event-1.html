            <p>This question was on everyone's lips after the final whistle. The team went into the break trailing 0-2. The Slytherins were fierce and technical, and Ron Weasley was on the verge of breaking down after his own mistake. But Hermione's tactical genius changed everything. She moved deeper and took control of the game, becoming a true playmaker. Ginny stretched the opponent's defense with her breakthroughs, and Neville, inspired by the team's support, made a key tackle that launched a counterattack. Two quick goals from Ginny evened the score. And in the last minute, Harry, nicknamed “The Seer Keeper,” saved the team by saving a penalty kick from the opposing captain, Draco Malfoy. This victory was achieved not by magic, but by the heart, mind, and indomitable team spirit of Gryffindor.</p>
