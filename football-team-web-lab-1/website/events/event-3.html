        <h2 class="event-title">Charity match against the Hogwarts Ghosts</h2>
        <p>It was the strangest match of their careers. Nick's headless team consisted of Hogwarts ghosts. The ball would occasionally pass through the bodies of opposing players, and their main striker, the Grey Lady, flew above the field. Harry's team couldn't use magic, so they had to get creative. Hermione figured out the pattern: the ghosts could only affect the ball when it touched the ground. They changed their tactics, playing high passes through the air. Harry, with his excellent eyesight, guided his teammates, pointing out where the “invisible” ball was flying. The match ended with a score of 1-1, and all the funds raised went to restore the school library. It was a game not for victory, but for understanding and cooperation with the inhabitants of the castle.</p>
